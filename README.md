# ECOL620
Repository for ECOL 620: Applications in Landscape Ecology
This repository is for all class assignments completed for ECOL 620. For the class we were given code to begin with and were asked to build upon it by manipulating spatial and aspatial data in sp, sf, raster and the tidyverse; visualizing vector and raster data with ggplot2; and modeling and assessing spatial relationships using a variety of packages.
